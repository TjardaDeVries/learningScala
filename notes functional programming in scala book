referential transparency (RT)
=============================
An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value
without changing the program's behavior.
An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque.

pure function
=============
As a result, evaluating a referentially transparent function gives the same value for same arguments.
Such functions are called pure functions.

var globalValue: Int = 0

def ro(x: Int) = {
  globalValue = globalValue + 1
  x + globalValue
}

def rt(x: Int) = {
  x + 1
}
